Description: Perform power analysis and/or precision analysis for sample means
  of continuous and binary metrics and sample quantiles of continuous metrics,
  assuming asymptotic normality. One can determine the minimum required sample
  size (MRSS), the minimum required duration (MRD), or the minimum detectable
  effect (MDE) and account for design effects due to arm imbalance, analysis of
  covariance (ANCOVA), and cluster randomization. There are also helper
  functions to forecast sample size growth over time to convert between
  sample size growth and duration.
